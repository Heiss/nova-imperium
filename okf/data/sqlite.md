# SQLite storage

The server stores game state and accounts in `nova.sqlite` in the configured
data directory. The schema covers accounts, sessions and invitations, planets,
fleets, reports, and universe settings.

On startup, the database enables foreign keys and uses WAL mode for on-disk
databases. Migrations are applied in order in a transaction, with the current
schema version recorded in SQLite's `user_version`. Store operations can group
related updates in a transaction.

In Docker Compose, the named data volume persists the database across container
replacements. Follow the [backup and restore procedure](../../docs/operations.md#backup-and-restore)
before upgrades.
